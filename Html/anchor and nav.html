      A
      <strong
        >BlockChain </strong> is a <del>Rs 500</del> 300 <ins>i have inserted</ins> lists of records
        (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic
        hashes.[1][2][3][4] <mark>Each block contains a cryptographic</mark>  hash of the
        previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
        as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The
        timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
        created. Since each block contains information about the previous block,
        they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with
        each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
        blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are
        recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
        without altering all subsequent blocks. Blockchains are typically
        managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
        distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus
        algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.<br>
        <br>
         Although
        blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are
        possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a
        distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5] A
        blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name
        (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public
        distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on
        previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6]
        The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first
        digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need
        of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has
        inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by
        the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may
        be considered a type of payment rail.[7] Private blockchains have been
        proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such
        privatized blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[8]
        however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully
        designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in
        practice than permissionless ones <sup>[4][9]</sup></strong
